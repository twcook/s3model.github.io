What is S3Model?
================

A system to solve cross-domain data interoperability.

The Problem
-----------

Current approaches to data modeling and processing does not allow for machine processable context to be associated with data in order to supply Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) algorithms with enough computable information.

The Solution
------------

* S3Model provides a means to add context to data in both a machine processable and human-readable manner.

* S3Model provides a consistent data structure to ease query processing across multiple domains of information.

* S3Model provides a consistent approach to go from document/tree structured data to Linked Data without loss of contextual fidelity.

* S3Model is provided under a business friendly open source license. Begin your introduction to the future of data modeling for AGI.
