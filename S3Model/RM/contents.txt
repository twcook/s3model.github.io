The published versions of the reference model are in subdirectories labeled with their version number, e.g. 1_0_0 for the first RM release.

The schema filename is 's3model_' with the version number appended, e.g. s3model_1_0_0.xsd for the first RM release.

A generated RDF file is also located in each subdirectory. 

The core concepts of S3Model are expressed in the s3model.owl file located here. 

A scripts directory contains python scripts that can be used to extract semantics from RM files or DM files as well as scripts for other example generation tasks.
