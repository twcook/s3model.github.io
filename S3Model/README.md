# S3Model

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DataInsightsInc/S3Model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DataInsightsInc/S3Model)

Shareable-Structured-Semantic Model (S3Model)
See the Documentation 'https://github.com/DataInsightsInc/S3Model/docs/index.html'


A S3Model Data Model (DM) XML Schema file is named using the CUID of the complexType restriction of ConceptType from the RM. The CUID is prepended with 'dm-' and has the file extension '.xsd'.


The rdf:about attribute of the rdf:Description defining the RDF/XML Subject prepends the file name with 'http://www.s3model.com/ns/s3m/'.  This rdf:Description then contains each Predicate/Object pair.


All Reference Models are named with their version number and are dereferenceable in the '/ns/s3m/' folder on the site. I.e. http://www.s3model.com/ns/s3m/s3model_3_1_0.xsd

The complexTypes in the RM named Xd* all descend from XdAnyType where Xd denotes e**X**tended **d**atatype.

Python Implementation
=====================
The Python 3.7+ implementation is in located in the project https://github.com/DataInsightsInc/S3MPython
There are tutorials included in the Jupyter notebooks.

See the Getting Started notebook.

You will need to install Anaconda for your platform.
https://www.anaconda.com/download/


Then create the S3Model environement with:
