Configuration
=============

.. warning::

    Only edit the configuration file with a text editor. Do not use a word processing application such as MS Word or LibreOffice. There are many great opensource and free text editors from which to choose.  Some favorites, in no particular order, are:

    - `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_
    - `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
    - `Sublime <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_

The initial translator.conf file should be okay for most uses and indeed for this initial tutorial. You are encouraged to make backup copies, under different names, of the configuration file for different use cases/projects. The active configuration, however, is always the one named **translator.conf**. The translator ships with a copy of the original config file named *default.conf* as well as a config file for the advanced tutorials named *advanced_tutorials.conf*. You can always go back to the initial settings by making a copy of the *default.conf* file and naming it *translator.conf*.
