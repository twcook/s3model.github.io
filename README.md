# S3Model → Semantic Data Charter

This repository now serves as a redirect page for the rebranded **Semantic Data Charter** project.

## What Happened?

S3Model has evolved into the **Semantic Data Charter™** (SDC4), a comprehensive standards-based specification for semantic data modeling built on 16+ international standards from W3C, ISO, and IETF.

## New Location

Visit the Semantic Data Charter at: **[https://semanticdatacharter.com](https://semanticdatacharter.com)**

## For Publication Readers

If you found this site through peer-reviewed publications referencing S3Model, all research, concepts, and specifications have been integrated into the Semantic Data Charter with enhanced capabilities and broader standards compliance.

## This Repository

This repository maintains the s3model.com domain redirect to ensure historical links continue to work and visitors are directed to the new site.
