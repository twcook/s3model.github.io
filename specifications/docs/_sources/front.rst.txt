Purpose & Scope
---------------
*Keep everything as simple as possible; but no simpler. - Albert Einstein*

The purpose of the S3Model project is to provide a free and openly available specification for
implementation of a model first system for information exchange.

The S3Model specifications are designed to provide computable semantic interoperability that is
entirely independent of any implementation specific contexts. Therefore workflow, security,
user access, and data persistence are all outside the scope of S3Model. However, S3Model does provide
a facility for managing workflow and user access within the data instances.

Data Insights, Inc. has a growing number of implementation projects and tools that demonstrate
this approach and enables interoperability across many contexts and domains.
`Online courses are also available <http://datainsights.tech/training>`_.

Conformance
-----------
Conformance to these specifications are represented in a Language Implementation Specification (LIS). An LIS is a formal document detailing the mappings and conventions used concerning these specifications.
An LIS is in direct conformance to these specifications when;

1. All datatypes are defined and mapped.
2. The value spaces of the datatypes used by the entity to be identical to the value spaces specified herein.
3. To the extent that the entity provides operations other than movement or translation of values, define operations on the datatypes which can be derived from, or are otherwise consistent with the characterizing operations specified herein.

Compliance
----------

These specifications;

- Are in indirect conformance with ISO/DIS 21090/2008.
- Comply with applicable sections of ISO 18308/2008.
- Comply with applicable sections of ISO/TR 20514:2005.
- Comply with applicable sections of ISO 13606-1:2007.
- Are in conformance with W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.0
- Are in conformance with W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) 1.1

Availability
------------

The S3Model specifications, reference implementation, and tools are available from the `S3Model <https://s3model.com>`_ website.
